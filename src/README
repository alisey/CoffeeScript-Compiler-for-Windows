How to build:

1. Download JSDB binaries from http://www.jsdb.org/
   You only need jsdb.exe
2. Download https://raw.github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/master/extras/coffee-script.js to this directory.
3. Zip *.js files from this directory to coffee.zip
4. Concatenate jsdb.exe and coffee.zip:
   copy /b jsdb.exe+coffee.zip coffee.exe
5. The resulting coffee.exe is a standalone CoffeeScript compiler
6. Optionally, change icon with resource editor (e.g. http://icofx.ro)
